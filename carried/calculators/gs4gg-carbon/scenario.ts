 * PEOPLE AND HOUSEHOLDS, DECIDED IN ONE PLACE AND IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
 * ([#225]; Amy's rulings of 2026-09-24, first and second rejections).
 *
 * A household-treatment project is counted two ways and the two are one fact:
 *
 *     households × household size = people          (the count entered as households)
 *     people ÷ household size    = households       (the count entered as people)
 *
 * Whichever way it was entered, the OTHER number is derived here — never on a screen, never
 * twice. `computeScenario` takes its people count from this function; the calculator seat and
 * the project record call it to SHOW both numbers and the size that ties them together.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY BOTH DIRECTIONS, AND WHY IT IS EXPORTED. The first build derived only one way and the
 * screens showed only one number, so a household count sat beside an N_p of the same value and
 * read as "that many people, one per house". The second rejection went further: entering PEOPLE on a
 * household project left the households unknown, so Eq.6 could not run at all. Amy withdrew the
 * earlier "nothing fires on People" instruction for exactly that reason — for HWT/IWT the
 * households are always knowable, and a number in force must be on screen. A second copy of this
 * rule in the UI would drift from the engine's, silently; one function, three readers.
 *
 * ⚠ THE DERIVED HOUSEHOLD COUNT IS NOT ROUNDED. A people count divided by a household size is
 * rarely a whole number, and rounding it would quietly break the identity the screens now print —
 * people ÷ households would stop equalling the household size shown. The figure is displayed as
 * it is used.
 *
 * Returns null when there is no count to work from, or (for `households`) on Method 1 (CWT/CWS),
 * which serves water points rather than treated households and decomposes into neither.
