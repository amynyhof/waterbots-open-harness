# BUILD_LOG.md — what was built, session by session

**Append-only. Never read at the opening.**

This file exists so that [SESSION_HANDOFF.md](./SESSION_HANDOFF.md) can stay thin. The handoff says
where things stand *now*; this says how they came to stand there. Maintainer's ruling,
29 Aug 2026 — the rule itself lives in
[PROCESS_RULES_for_ShellB.md](./PROCESS_RULES_for_ShellB.md) under *the opening reads stay thin,
forever*, and this file does not restate it.

**It is not one of the six opening documents and must never become one.** A session starts by
reading the current state, not the history. This is looked at when someone goes looking for how a
thing came to be, and at no other time.

## How it is written

- **One entry per session**, appended at the close, after the root docs are refreshed and before
  the checkpoint is committed.
- **Nothing already in it is ever edited.** A correction is a *new* entry that names what it
  corrects and why — the visible-corrections rule applied to a log rather than to a claim. An entry
  that quietly changed would make the whole file untrustworthy, which is the one thing a log cannot
  survive.
- **It records what happened, not what is required.** Rules live in the rulebooks; open threads
  live in [OPEN_ITEMS.md](./OPEN_ITEMS.md); the order of work lives in
  [BUILD_PLAN.md](./BUILD_PLAN.md).
- **An incident is recorded fully in the item that owns it**, per *record once, point everywhere
  else*. An entry here carries two lines and a pointer, not a second account that can drift.

## Entries

Newest last.

**Entries begin with the session of 29 Aug 2026**, which is the session this file was created in.
**Earlier history is not lost and has not been moved yet** — it currently sits in the "Before that"
and "Just finished" sections of [BUILD_PLAN.md](./BUILD_PLAN.md) and in each item's own row in
[OPEN_ITEMS.md](./OPEN_ITEMS.md). Sweeping it here is ordinary tidying, not a ruling, and it is
recorded as owed rather than done so that this file does not open with a false claim of
completeness.
