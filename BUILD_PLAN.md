# BUILD_PLAN.md — what is being built, and why

Which family of work is being built now, which comes next, and what each one is
waiting on. **This file commits to an order, not to dates.**

Read it with [OPEN_ITEMS.md](./OPEN_ITEMS.md), which holds the items themselves
and the north star they lead toward, and with
[PROCESS_RULES_for_ShellB.md](./PROCESS_RULES_for_ShellB.md), which says how work
moves from a proposal to a commit.

**This file is rewritten whenever the plan changes**, and refreshed at every
session close, so it never describes a plan we have already left behind.

## Compatibility goal

**This is the standing direction. It sits under the north star in
[OPEN_ITEMS.md](./OPEN_ITEMS.md) and shapes how everything below is built.**

**Shell B is heading toward compatibility with the production console.** Someone
who steps up to the paid platform should find the step seamless: the same
behaviours and the same shapes, in a different colour, with more tabs. What a
person learns on the free surfaces keeps working when they cross over.

**The final look is not settled, and this is not a one-way copy.** Some of what
this shell works out may flow back the other way. **Which parts settle where is
decided in a design session with the production side** — not in this repository,
and not by an engineer working in it.

**The brand book is the design authority, and it is version 4 from 30 Aug 2026.** ~~BRAND.md v3 is
the design authority — 28 Aug 2026.~~ Version 3 held for two days. The book governs both properties
and is complete on its own page. It lives at `brand/BRAND.md`, gitignored, and does not publish. ~~The design canon is the outcome of the session this file was waiting on.~~ **The
canon is superseded by the book** and says so at its own head; it stays published as history, and
where the two disagree the book wins.

**The canon's rulings were not wrong.** The Frost light theme, the left rail with its "Collapse" row
and "<" glyph, and the chat dock's citation and formatting rules were all carried into the book and
live there now. Both of the things it asked for are done: the brightness pull-up shipped on 27 Aug
(item S8, now closed) and the rail-width rider rode on 29 Aug when the rail was next opened.

**Three rules held while we waited. Two of them are permanent and one has done its job.**

1. **Build to this repository's own rules.** [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md),
   [AGENT_RULES.md](./AGENT_RULES.md), [CITATIONS.md](./CITATIONS.md),
   [DESIGN_CANON_for_ShellB.md](./DESIGN_CANON_for_ShellB.md) and the brand book
   are what binds. The compatibility goal is a direction, not a specification, and it
   does not override any of them. **Still holds.**
2. **Flag drift as an open item, in its family.** This one was for the design
   session, and the design session has happened. **It is retired as a standing
   rule**, and what it was collecting is now settled by the canon. Anything that
   still looks like drift is an ordinary open item.
3. **Never copy from, fetch from, or match the production site unaided.** Not its
   files, not its shapes, not its wording, and not by inference from memory. This
   is rule zero in CLAUDE.md and the wall in CITATIONS.md, applied to design.
   **A compatibility goal is not permission to go and look** — rules travel as
   rules, and they travel by the maintainer's hand. **Still holds**, and the canon
   restates it itself.

## Just finished — the return to the brand book

**Sessions of 29 and 30 Aug 2026. Eleven pull requests, #27 to #37, all merged.** The brand book
arrived on 28 Aug and this is the work of bringing the shipped stylesheet to it.

**The history of how it was done is in [BUILD_LOG.md](./BUILD_LOG.md)**, which is append-only and is
never read at the opening. This section says only what is now true.

**What the site is, after it:**

- **One light brand.** The dark theme and the theme switch are gone; there is one set of tokens.
- **Two grounds.** `--paper` `#F6F5FA` is the content canvas — the map and the worksheet. `--frame`
  `#FBFBFE` is the frame — top bar, rail, and both docks' ground. Content warm, frame lighter and
  quieter.
- **Three planes and no fourth.** The derived `--chrome` plane is retired.
- **The book's names and values** — neutrals as `--ink*`, the book's hairline and radii, three
  shadow tokens applied only to what genuinely floats.
- **Accent-tinted host panels.** Both chat docks and the legend carry their host's accent at the
  book's 5% fill and 25% border. Bridget is **Surf `#14C8D9`**, settled.
- **A basemap wash**, Slate at 13%, which is where the map's richness came from.

**The stress ramp is unchanged.** A ramp change was designed, machine-checked, walked and withdrawn
— the finding was that the map read flat because of the basemap, not the data. Item S9 carries it.

~~**Four rulings are owed to the master brand book by the maintainer's hand**, listed once in item
S9: the two grounds, the active nav item, the three shadow values, and Slate as a basemap wash.~~
**All four landed in version 4 on 30 Aug 2026** — §2.3, §2.3, §4 and §7. Item S9 records where each
one sits. **Driftwood was proposed and refused on the merits** and is struck from that list; §2.1
keeps the strike rather than erasing it.

## Building next — two raises against version 4

~~**The brand work is done and no family is due.** What comes next is decided at the next session's
open, and it waits on one thing arriving by the maintainer's hand: **BRAND.md version 4**.~~
**Version 4 arrived on 30 Aug 2026** by the maintainer's hand, and this section is rewritten around
what it changed.

**The shipped surfaces match version 4 in almost every value** — all ten accents, both recorded
spares, the four neutrals, the hairline, all seven radii, the five states, all seven crew hues, the
two grounds, the active navigation item, the wash at 13%. **Two things do not**, and both are open
in item S9:

1. **The shadow values.** §4 now publishes all three and says the token file already agrees. It does
   not: `--shadow-md` and `--shadow-lg` differ here. **Ruled 30 Aug 2026 — the book wins**, and the
   swap is its own step with the maintainer's eyeball on it.
2. **Coral set as text.** Two map error messages use `--state-warn` as 11px type at **3.52:1**,
   under the 4.5:1 §9 asks for. The book publishes a darkened value for live, approved and
   verification, and **none for coral**, so one is proposed and carried up by hand rather than
   invented here.

**The design exploration leaves no artefact here, and that is deliberate.** Its outcome — the cool
end that was ruled, the hybrid that was built, and the finding that withdrew it — is recorded in
full in item S9. Maintainer's ruling, 30 Aug 2026: **the screenshots are not coming, because there
is nothing left for images to teach.** No folder waits for them.

## Not next, and why

| Family | Why it waits |
|---|---|
| **Knowledge** | Large and unbounded until the full-docs card pass (item K1) reports what card sets are actually needed. Doing it in the wrong order means writing cards nobody asked for. |
| **Surfaces** | The bridge (item S7) was ruled on 26 Aug 2026 but has no proposal — the shape of the handoff is coordinated by the maintainer's hand. The brightness pull-up (item S8) is **closed**, and the return to the book (item S9) is **open on two raises against version 4** — the shadow values, ruled and awaiting its own step, and coral set as text, awaiting a value carried into the book by hand. The rest of the family is polish (item S5), the dev-relay gap (item S6), or waits on data that does not exist yet (item S1). |
| **Data** | Blocked on material the maintainer supplies — registry coordinates for the project points (item D2), public disclosures for corporate goals and target geographies (item D1). Not work that can start from inside the repository. |
| **Operations** | **Nothing is due.** What remains waits on real usage that does not exist yet: the number twenty (item O1), the basemap's five-million-request ceiling (item O9), and the primer review against the abstention log (item A5). Two questions are open and unhurried — whether the export copies should be produced by a script (item O8), and whether an abstention that cited a card is a fault at all (item A7, waiting on a recurrence). |
