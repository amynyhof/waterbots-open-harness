# BUILD_PLAN.md — what is being built, and why

Which family of work is being built now, which comes next, and what each one is
waiting on. **This file commits to an order, not to dates.**

Read it with [OPEN_ITEMS.md](./OPEN_ITEMS.md), which holds the items themselves
and the north star they lead toward, and with
[PROCESS_RULES_for_ShellB.md](./PROCESS_RULES_for_ShellB.md), which says how work
moves from a proposal to a commit.

**This file is rewritten whenever the plan changes**, and refreshed at every
session close, so it never describes a plan we have already left behind.

## Compatibility goal

**This is the standing direction. It sits under the north star in
[OPEN_ITEMS.md](./OPEN_ITEMS.md) and shapes how everything below is built.**

**Shell B is heading toward compatibility with the production console.** Someone
who steps up to the paid platform should find the step seamless: the same
behaviours and the same shapes, in a different colour, with more tabs. What a
person learns on the free surfaces keeps working when they cross over.

**The final look is not settled, and this is not a one-way copy.** Some of what
this shell works out may flow back the other way. **Which parts settle where is
decided in a design session with the production side** — not in this repository,
and not by an engineer working in it.

**BRAND.md v3 is the design authority — 28 Aug 2026.** It governs both properties and is complete
on its own page. ~~The design canon is the outcome of the session this file was waiting on.~~ **The
canon is superseded by the book** and says so at its own head; it stays published as history, and
where the two disagree the book wins.

**The canon's rulings were not wrong.** The Frost light theme, the left rail with its "Collapse" row
and "<" glyph, and the chat dock's citation and formatting rules were all carried into the book and
live there now. Both of the things it asked for are done: the brightness pull-up shipped on 27 Aug
(item S8, now closed) and the rail-width rider rode on 29 Aug when the rail was next opened.

**Three rules held while we waited. Two of them are permanent and one has done its job.**

1. **Build to this repository's own rules.** [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md),
   [AGENT_RULES.md](./AGENT_RULES.md), [CITATIONS.md](./CITATIONS.md),
   [DESIGN_CANON_for_ShellB.md](./DESIGN_CANON_for_ShellB.md) and BRAND.md are
   what binds. The compatibility goal is a direction, not a specification, and it
   does not override any of them. **Still holds.**
2. **Flag drift as an open item, in its family.** This one was for the design
   session, and the design session has happened. **It is retired as a standing
   rule**, and what it was collecting is now settled by the canon. Anything that
   still looks like drift is an ordinary open item.
3. **Never copy from, fetch from, or match the production site unaided.** Not its
   files, not its shapes, not its wording, and not by inference from memory. This
   is rule zero in CLAUDE.md and the wall in CITATIONS.md, applied to design.
   **A compatibility goal is not permission to go and look** — rules travel as
   rules, and they travel by the maintainer's hand. **Still holds**, and the canon
   restates it itself.

## Just finished — the return to the brand book

**Sessions of 29 and 30 Aug 2026. Eleven pull requests, #27 to #37, all merged.** The brand book
arrived on 28 Aug and this is the work of bringing the shipped stylesheet to it.

**The history of how it was done is in [BUILD_LOG.md](./BUILD_LOG.md)**, which is append-only and is
never read at the opening. This section says only what is now true.

**What the site is, after it:**

- **One light brand.** The dark theme and the theme switch are gone; there is one set of tokens.
- **Two grounds.** `--paper` `#F6F5FA` is the content canvas — the map and the worksheet. `--frame`
  `#FBFBFE` is the frame — top bar, rail, and both docks' ground. Content warm, frame lighter and
  quieter.
- **Three planes and no fourth.** The derived `--chrome` plane is retired.
- **The book's names and values** — neutrals as `--ink*`, the book's hairline and radii, three
  shadow tokens applied only to what genuinely floats.
- **Accent-tinted host panels.** Both chat docks and the legend carry their host's accent at the
  book's 5% fill and 25% border. Bridget is **Surf `#14C8D9`**, settled.
- **A basemap wash**, Slate at 13%, which is where the map's richness came from.

**The stress ramp is unchanged.** A ramp change was designed, machine-checked, walked and withdrawn
— the finding was that the map read flat because of the basemap, not the data. Item S9 carries it.

**Four rulings are owed to the master brand book by the maintainer's hand**, listed once in item S9:
the two grounds, the active nav item, the three shadow values, and Slate as a basemap wash.
**Driftwood was proposed and refused on the merits** and is struck from that list.

## Building next — nothing is scheduled

**The brand work is done and no family is due.** What comes next is decided at the next session's
open, and it waits on one thing arriving by the maintainer's hand: **BRAND.md version 4**.

**Until it lands, the shipped surfaces match version 3 of the book** and the open items below are
what remains.

**The design exploration leaves no artefact here, and that is deliberate.** Its outcome — the cool
end that was ruled, the hybrid that was built, and the finding that withdrew it — is recorded in
full in item S9. Maintainer's ruling, 30 Aug 2026: **the screenshots are not coming, because there
is nothing left for images to teach.** No folder waits for them.

## Not next, and why

| Family | Why it waits |
|---|---|
| **Knowledge** | Large and unbounded until the full-docs card pass (item K1) reports what card sets are actually needed. Doing it in the wrong order means writing cards nobody asked for. |
| **Surfaces** | The bridge (item S7) was ruled on 26 Aug 2026 but has no proposal — the shape of the handoff is coordinated by the maintainer's hand. The brightness pull-up (item S8) is **closed**, and the return to the book (item S9) is **open only on the four rulings owed to the master book by the maintainer's hand**. The rest of the family is polish (item S5), the dev-relay gap (item S6), or waits on data that does not exist yet (item S1). |
| **Data** | Blocked on material the maintainer supplies — registry coordinates for the project points (item D2), public disclosures for corporate goals and target geographies (item D1). Not work that can start from inside the repository. |
| **Operations** | **Nothing is due.** What remains waits on real usage that does not exist yet: the number twenty (item O1), the basemap's five-million-request ceiling (item O9), and the primer review against the abstention log (item A5). Two questions are open and unhurried — whether the export copies should be produced by a script (item O8), and whether an abstention that cited a card is a fault at all (item A7, waiting on a recurrence). |
